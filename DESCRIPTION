Description: For any given affinity purification mass spectrometry experiment (AP-MS), a large number of non-specific background proteins will contaminate the results unless they are screened out. cRomppass implements the CompPASS algorithm to score a set of bait-prey interactions from several AP-MS experiments against each other or a separate set of prior experiments.
